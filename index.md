*There are two books on the shelf. One is a dark-reddish notebook that has NOTES skribble on the front of it. Loose pages threatening to fall out if it at any time. The other is a blue covered, neat little journal that reads ARTICLES neatly written on it. It has a lock on it.*

- [NOTES](https://notes.99000000.xyz)
- [ARTICLES](https://articles.99000000.xyz)

*Above it is a bulletin board with many sticky notes, pinned up messages, and other random junk.*
