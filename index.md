*There are two books on the shelf. One is a dark-reddish notebook that has NOTES skribble on the front of it. Loose pages threatening to fall out if it at any time. The other is a blue covered, neat little journal that reads ARTICLES neatly written on it. It has a lock on it.*

*Which one do you pick up?*
